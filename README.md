### Python graph DB ORM

graphpy is a migration free plug and play ORM for any Python project. It was inspired by the graph db module from [graphp](https://github.com/mikeland86/graphp). It allows you to build quick and dirty db based models using a graph abstraction on top of MySQL.

*graphpy is a work in progress*
